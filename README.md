# PlayersDropHeads

## Basics

### What does this mod do?
This mod makes players drop their heads when they die.

### How do I use this mod?
You need Minecraft Forge installed first. Once that's done, just drop
playersdropheads-*version*.jar in your Minecraft instance's mods/ directory
and, optionally, configure it to taste.

### What settings does this mod have?
You can set the chance that a player drops their head separately for three
different categories of deaths: PvP kills, charged creeper kills, and all
others. By default, all of these are set to 1.0, so all player deaths will
unconditionally result in a head drop.

## Development

### How do I compile this mod from source?
You need a JDK installed first. Start a command prompt or terminal in the
directory you downloaded the source to. If you're on Windows, type
`gradlew.bat build`. Otherwise, type `./gradlew build`. Once it's done, the mod
will be saved to build/libs/playersdropheads-*version*.jar.

### How can I contribute to this mod's development?

## Licensing/Permissions

### What license is this released under?

### Can I use this in my modpack?
Yes, even if you monetize it with adf.ly or something, and you don't need to
ask me for my permission first.
